##  To Run the Backup Script Every Hour on Windows

You can use **Windows Task Scheduler** to run the Python script every hour automatically.

---

### 🛠️ Step-by-step Setup:

1. **Open Task Scheduler**
   Press `Windows + R`, type `taskschd.msc`, hit **Enter**.

2. **Create Basic Task**
   - Click **“Create Basic Task…”**
   - Name it: `PostgreSQL Backup Every Hour`

3. **Trigger**
   - Choose **“Daily”**
   - Set **Start time** (e.g., 12:00 AM)
   - On the next screen, choose **Repeat task every 1 hour** for **1 day**

4. **Action**
   - Choose **“Start a program”**

5. **Program/script**
   Enter the path to your **Python executable**, for example:

   ```
   wscript.exe

   ```

6. **Add Arguments (optional)**
   Add the path to your script:

   ```
   "H:\BusinessApp\backup\run_backup_silent.vbs"
   ```

7. **Finish**
   Click **Finish**, then go to **Task Scheduler Library**, find your task, right-click → **Properties**.

---

###  In Properties (Advanced Settings):

1. In **Triggers → Edit**
   - Set: Repeat task every **1 hour**
   - For a duration of: **1 day**
   - Enabled:

2. In **Conditions**
   - Uncheck **"Start the task only if the computer is on AC power"** if needed.

3. In **Settings**
   - Enable **“Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed”**
   - Enable **“If the task fails, restart every 5 minutes” (optional)**

---

### 🔁 Bonus: To run script every 10 minutes, just change the repeat time

Let me know if you want to:
- Log output to a file
- Add desktop notifications when backup completes
- Zip the SQL files to save space

Want me to generate a `.bat` file or Task Scheduler XML for this?
